			Hello everyone! My name is Jebediah Wordsmith and I am an etymology theorist. I am also a blogger and
			definitely a credible journalist who isn't making anything up. As I was walking along a wooded path 
			one day in my hometown, Bozeman, Montana, I began to wonder, "what is the etymology of some of our 
			language's most common phrases?" I decided to take it upon myself to find the answers to those questions.
			So, using my adept and versed (no, I didn't need to look those words up to remind myself of their meaning nor
			their spelling) journalist skills, I have found the roots of many of our language and culture's key phrases. Yes,
			these are 100% real and not just made up by some bored college student or anything facetious like that.
			<br><br>
			I am a scholar and offspring of a long lineage of intellectuals. My great-grandparents are Merriam and Webster
			Dictionary, and I have convinced myself thoroughly that I am related to Denis Diderot. Need further proof of my
			credibility? On Sunday mornings you can find me sipping coffee with my pet Thesaurus. Like many other theorists 
			of my caliber, I both use the word scoff and perform some variation of a scoffing action on a daily basis. 
			"Oh, you enjoy such things as comedy, football, and crocheting? Scoff I say." Anyways, I digress. Please 
			enjoy this blog, the articles of which I've written on a typewriter and had a more clerically skilled person
			rewrite on the line. Remember, these blogs are true, without a shadow of a doubt (a phrase which you will learn 
			more about if you choose to read further).
