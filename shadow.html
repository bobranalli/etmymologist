			Just as the waves ebb and flow with the Moon's motion, shadows shift and shape themselves with the Sun's stirring. 
			Similar to the Earth's waves and shadows, the theory to explain the phrase "Shadow of a Doubt" changes. Unlike 
			these natural wonders, the phrase's etymology changes less predictably - the origins of "A Shadow of a Doubt" are at
			the whim of the faulty etymologist, while the waves and shadows of our day are controlled by celestial bodies.
			I am here to set the phrase on a course for truth, and hopefully convince you all of its true nature. Please forgive
			the etymologists before me and their inability to conduct proper research. Per usual, I will begin by debunking the
			popular explanations, then present my own (the truthful origin). 
			<br><br>
			Commonly, the phrase in its entirety is "beyond a shadow of a doubt" or "without a shadow of a doubt." Some fools 
			believe that the origins are associated with 16th century England, where people would refer to a man who was 
			significantly reduced from his earlier, younger stature as a "shadow of a man." The connection being that a shadow 
			is so minuscule that it is insubstantial. Therefore "beyond a shadow of a doubt" would refer to even the smallest most
			inconsequential shard of doubt being considered and proved past consideration. Supposedly, the earliest usage of this 
			direct phrase was in English court in the 18th century when a judge was being faulted for a crime, and his alibi was
			thorough enough to prove his innocence "beyond the shadow of a doubt."
			<br><br>
			Now that we've waded through the wave of false origin, it is time to discuss the true etymology. It's the year 900 
			B.C.E and you're an archer standing guard in your city's watch tower. You gaze out at the horizon as you watch a cloud
			of dust rise up from the dry, sandy ground. You realize too late that this isn't some Earthly sandstorm, it's the 
			Assyrians marching towards your city. As they approach closer, you hear the clanking of armor, the hoorahs and hollers 
			of men ready to strike you down. And lastly, most terrifyingly, you see siege engines rolling on ancient, wooden 
			wheels. You alert your fellow watchmen, you ready your city's small, insignificant army. The siege engines grow larger 
			as they approach - their shadows cast massive forms of doom on the ground beneath them. You've heard stories of such
			machines of destruction, yet this is the first you've seen. You have heard these engineering anomalies to be called 
			"Shadows of Doubt" for the fear and certainty they present. "The Shadows of Doubt are coming!" You scream to your 
			fellow watchmen, to which one replies "and without a shadow of a doubt, we're fucked."
			<br><br>
			So, there it is. The completely true tale of where the phrase "Shadow of a Doubt" came from. The Assyrians created 
			machines so powerful even their shadows struck doubt into their enemies and brought along certain destruction. Please 
			feel free to offer any other comments about this phrase and suggestions for a phrase you are curious about. A loyal
			reader and fellow theologian just suggested "Breaking the Ice" which will be covered next week.
