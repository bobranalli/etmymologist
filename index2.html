			If you're reading this blog you of course had the same question as myself, where does the phrase "Boxing Day" come
			from? Luckily for you, I've decided to put my journalist skills to test, and get to the bottom of this mystery.
			Finding the answer to this rather unassuming question proved harder than I originally thought. It took hours
			of research and diligent detective work to surf through the heaps and piles of false information and inaccuracies
			contributed by my peers and fellow journalists. So, enough fluff, where does "Boxing Day" come from...
			<br><br>
			If you were to ask a fool (or any of the so-called etymologists who all went to their preppy schools of which I 
			got rejected to due my "utter lack of both ability and understanding of the linguistic science"), they would most
			likely tell you that Boxing Day originated in the 1830s when boxes filled with small gifts and money would be given
			to household servants and employees on the 26th who had to work on December 25. Another similarly inept etymologist
			might tell you that the phrase Boxing Day has its roots in the Middle Ages, where giving gifts to the poor, more 
			specifically (and more incorrectly) it may reference the alms box placed in the narthex of Christian churches to 
			collect donations for the poor. As you might realize at this point, we're dealing with many low-level etymologists 
			who don't respect simple facts. How am I so sure that these leading theories are wrong? 
			<br><br>
			Let's start with the first one - they say that gifts were given in small boxes to the poor starting in the 1830s, 
			well cardboard wasn't even invented until the 1870s so how could they possibly have formed those small boxes? And 
			to those of you who are at this moment asking, couldn't they have made the boxes out of wood? No. Think about the 
			amount of wooden boxes that would need to be made. How many woodworkers do you think their were in the 1830s? It's 
			not like they grow on trees as their material companions due. And for the second theory - supposedly Boxing Day 
			can be traced back to the middle ages where people would donate gifts the poor. It was the Middle Ages, also known 
			as the Dark Ages. Everyone was poor, everything sucked back then. If people were giving gifts to the poor, they'd 
			be giving gifts to themselves, and there's no chance that would be established as the origin of a holiday. 
			Furthermore, if that is in fact the origin (kudos to the etymologist who got lucky on this one) then I refuse to 
			accept a self-serving holiday of indulgence and closehandedness. Now that we've debunked many of the leading 
			theories, I will present my case (also known as the definitely heavily researched truth).
			<br><br>
			Many of the scholars (if you can call them that) before me have overlooked the simplest answer to the question
			"where did Boxing Day originate?" It's called <i>Boxing</i> Day not "Box" Day, nor is it called "Middle and Dark 
			Ages People Find a Small Religious Box and Put Things Inside Said Box Day." Boxing has been around since the 
			earliest civilizations. Sumerians and Akkadians were boxing one another between the Tigris and Euphrates - they
			probably did at least, I didn't want to step on any historians' toes and conduct historical research, but take 
			my word for it, those Sumerians could pack a decent punch. So, how does the origin of boxing relate to the 26th of 
			December? Astute question. It is well known that Jesus was born on December 25th, but it is probably lesser known 
			that Jesus had a stellar left hand. Turn water into wine? How about turning rocks into gravel with a single jab. 
			While digging for the origin of Boxing Day I found that the very first Catholic Church, the first church to 
			worship Jesus, was constructed on December 26th using the gravel that was shaped by Jesus's <i>Fists of Glory.</i>
			So, there is it - after hours and hours of etymological research, the true origin of Boxing Day uncovered.
			<br><br>
			I hope you all have enjoyed reading, and I hope I have shed light on the lesser-understood Holiday that is Boxing 
			Day. If you have any comments, please leave them in the suggestion box in the "Suggestions" tab. If you choose to 
			disagree with me in any way, please be prepared to be proved wrong (or banned if the former option is not 
			possible). In addition, please leave a suggestion for any other phrases or words whose etymology you are curious 
			about.

			The lights are low. The mood is slow. The wine is high. And your clothes are fly. It's the perfect night. 
			As you sip your drink and look across the restaurant you think to yourself "I'm dressed to the nines."
			It then pops into your non-etymologist brain "wait, that phrase makes no sense." And I would agree with you -  
			only if I didn't have the unique skill to decipher the finest of linguistic mysteries our language has to offer. 
			For those of you who haven't the slightest clue what I'm talking about - the phrase "dressed to the nines" typically
			refers to someone being well dressed and adorning fancy clothes. This is not to be confused with peacocking, which 
			is when a man dresses in highly ostentatious clothing to grab the attention of a woman. I can say with great 
			certainty that this not only isn't the same thing as being dressed to the nines, but it also does not work (don't
			believe me? Maybe you'll believe my pink leopard print shirt that's covered in wine from the last woman I tried to
			approach at the bar...). Now that we have some of the more general, but imperative information out of the way, 
			let's start uncovering this ridiculous saying by debunking some of the leading theories.
			<br><br>
			If you were an etymologist with little integrity and an even littler brain, you might explain the origins of 
			"dressed to the nines" as a reference to the Nine Muses of Arts and Learning (Clio, Erato, Calliope, Melpomene, 
			Euterpe, Polyhymnia, Terpsichore, Urania, and Thalia). The Nine Muses were often reference by poets and writers 
			and more specifically "to the nines" was used in writing in the 18th century to reference someone's well crafted 
			writing. The phrase "dressed to the nines" then became an extrapolation of "to the nines" as a way to describe the 
			perfection of someone's clothing. Sounds good, right? Wrong. This might check out "historically" to some degree, 
			but have you seen the way those Muses would dress? View the photo below.

			<br><br><img class = "muses_image" src="muses.jpeg" alt="the nine muses"> <br>
			
			The Nine Muses circle around Apollo wearing
			nothing but blank, monotonous white robes. You're a Greek God and can't find a silk blouse or an Oxford shirt to 
			throw on? Clearly these so-called Muses were not the inspiration for a phrase about fashion. Basing a phrase about 
			being well dressed on the Nine Muses would be like a non-etymologist basing an entire blog on etymology (absolutely 
			senseless and I wouldn't stand for it).
			<br><br>
			Moving ahead now, we've demystified one of the most prominent theories (and one of the most incorrect) behind the 
			phrase "Dressed to the Nines." Sadly, our work here is not done. Another leading and equally pathetic theory 
			regarding the amount of fabric needed to create a suit. According to some etymologists with nothing better to do
			than to make up fake origin stories, our phrase in question refers to tailors needing nine yards of materials to
			create one suit of clothing. This theory is just sad. What a ridiculous thing to believe. Nine yards of fabric could
			suit a woolly mammoth. So, either tailors used to simply hack away at 9 yards of fabric until it magically turned 
			itself into a suit, or this origin is flat out false. In this case, I choose to side with the tailors and I believe
			they'd have some level of competency to create a suit without needing a truck-full of fabric to do it. Yet again,
			another theory washed away. So, what is the true origin of "Dressed to the Nines?"
			<br><br>
			It's 6000BC, and you've just heard the announcement from your local South Caucasus bard - "the wine is ready." The 
			most recent vat of grape juice is ready to be pulled from underground. The grape juice fermentation process is 
			finished and that silly "kids juice" has developed into "fun juice." As per tradition, it's time to put on your 
			wine clothes - which similarly to today is dark, preferably black or purple clothing to hide your drunken spills and
			splashes. "Dress to the Wines" the people around you chant. This was a highly celebratory time as the entire 
			village could drink their faces off and forget about the stresses of the time - such as being trampled by a mammoth 
			or being struck down by one of their many different Gods. We can thank our heroes, the ancient Georgians
			not only for their tremendous phraseology, but their inventive fermentation processes as well. Sadly, overtime, 
			just as grape juice turned into red wine, the phrase "Dress to the Wines" developed into "Dressed to the Nines."  
			Once the South Caucasus empires fell, so did their language and cultures. Their traditions of dressing in wine 
			clothes, and chanting "dress to the wines" crashed into oblivion. As their language was being deciphered, many 
			mistakes were made (typical language-uncoverers (and yes that's what they're called)). Sadly, the prominent phrase
			of the times was forgotten, then rediscovered and changed into "Dressed to the Nines." An old plaque was found in 
			the ruins of a Neolithic village in the nation of Georgia - the plaque was cracked and fragmented and barely 
			legible. But it was still translated, and our friend the language-uncoverer made sure to do a real bang-up job of
			it. The original text read "Dress to the Wines" yet this plaque was falsely translated and the improper phrase 
			"Dressed to the Nines" was born." So, next time you sit down to drink a glass of red wine, remember to pay respects 
			to our alcoholic ancestors, the Ancient South Caucasus People. Raise your glass, put on your wine clothes and 
			"Dress to the Wines."
