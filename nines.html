			The lights are low. The mood is slow. The wine is high. And your clothes are fly. It's the perfect night. 
			As you sip your drink and look across the restaurant you think to yourself "I'm dressed to the nines."
			It then pops into your non-etymologist brain "wait, that phrase makes no sense." And I would agree with you -  
			only if I didn't have the unique skill to decipher the finest of linguistic mysteries our language has to offer. 
			For those of you who haven't the slightest clue what I'm talking about - the phrase "dressed to the nines" typically
			refers to someone being well dressed and adorning fancy clothes. This is not to be confused with peacocking, which 
			is when a man dresses in highly ostentatious clothing to grab the attention of a woman. I can say with great 
			certainty that this not only isn't the same thing as being dressed to the nines, but it also does not work (don't
			believe me? Maybe you'll believe my pink leopard print shirt that's covered in wine from the last woman I tried to
			approach at the bar...). Now that we have some of the more general, but imperative information out of the way, 
			let's start uncovering this ridiculous saying by debunking some of the leading theories.
			<br><br>
			If you were an etymologist with little integrity and an even littler brain, you might explain the origins of 
			"dressed to the nines" as a reference to the Nine Muses of Arts and Learning (Clio, Erato, Calliope, Melpomene, 
			Euterpe, Polyhymnia, Terpsichore, Urania, and Thalia). The Nine Muses were often reference by poets and writers 
			and more specifically "to the nines" was used in writing in the 18th century to reference someone's well crafted 
			writing. The phrase "dressed to the nines" then became an extrapolation of "to the nines" as a way to describe the 
			perfection of someone's clothing. Sounds good, right? Wrong. This might check out "historically" to some degree, 
			but have you seen the way those Muses would dress? View the photo below.
			
			<br><br><img class = "muses_image" src="muses.jpeg" alt="the nine muses"> <br>
			
			The Nine Muses circle around Apollo wearing
			nothing but blank, monotonous white robes. You're a Greek God and can't find a silk blouse or an Oxford shirt to 
			throw on? Clearly these so-called Muses were not the inspiration for a phrase about fashion. Basing a phrase about 
			being well dressed on the Nine Muses would be like a non-etymologist basing an entire blog on etymology (absolutely 
			senseless and I wouldn't stand for it).
			<br><br>
			Moving ahead now, we've demystified one of the most prominent theories (and one of the most incorrect) behind the 
			phrase "Dressed to the Nines." Sadly, our work here is not done. Another leading and equally pathetic theory 
			regarding the amount of fabric needed to create a suit. According to some etymologists with nothing better to do
			than to make up fake origin stories, our phrase in question refers to tailors needing nine yards of materials to
			create one suit of clothing. This theory is just sad. What a ridiculous thing to believe. Nine yards of fabric could
			suit a woolly mammoth. So, either tailors used to simply hack away at 9 yards of fabric until it magically turned 
			itself into a suit, or this origin is flat out false. In this case, I choose to side with the tailors and I believe
			they'd have some level of competency to create a suit without needing a truck-full of fabric to do it. Yet again,
			another theory washed away. So, what is the true origin of "Dressed to the Nines?"
			<br><br>
			It's 6000BC, and you've just heard the announcement from your local South Caucasus bard - "the wine is ready." The 
			most recent vat of grape juice is ready to be pulled from underground. The grape juice fermentation process is 
			finished and that silly "kids juice" has developed into "fun juice." As per tradition, it's time to put on your 
			wine clothes - which similarly to today is dark, preferably black or purple clothing to hide your drunken spills and
			splashes. "Dress to the Wines" the people around you chant. This was a highly celebratory time as the entire 
			village could drink their faces off and forget about the stresses of the time - such as being trampled by a mammoth 
			or being struck down by one of their many different Gods. We can thank our heroes, the ancient Georgians
			not only for their tremendous phraseology, but their inventive fermentation processes as well. Sadly, overtime, 
			just as grape juice turned into red wine, the phrase "Dress to the Wines" developed into "Dressed to the Nines."  
			Once the South Caucasus empires fell, so did their language and cultures. Their traditions of dressing in wine 
			clothes, and chanting "dress to the wines" crashed into oblivion. As their language was being deciphered, many 
			mistakes were made (typical language-uncoverers (and yes that's what they're called)). Sadly, the prominent phrase
			of the times was forgotten, then rediscovered and changed into "Dressed to the Nines." An old plaque was found in 
			the ruins of a Neolithic village in the nation of Georgia - the plaque was cracked and fragmented and barely 
			legible. But it was still translated, and our friend the language-uncoverer made sure to do a real bang-up job of
			it. The original text read "Dress to the Wines" yet this plaque was falsely translated and the improper phrase 
			"Dressed to the Nines" was born." So, next time you sit down to drink a glass of red wine, remember to pay respects 
			to our alcoholic ancestors, the Ancient South Caucasus People. Raise your glass, put on your wine clothes and 
			"Dress to the Wines."
