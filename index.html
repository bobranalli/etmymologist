					<p class = "home-text">Welcome to the roaring 20s. You're a bachelor out on the town and you're looking for
						that special someone. You've put on your sharpest tie-jacket-blazer combination and you're ready to 
						roll. The only way you'd describe yourself is "Dressed to the Nines." The only thing stopping you from 
						describing yourself this way is you have no idea where this phrase came from, or why it means what it 
						does. Luckily for you, I'm here to help. Look no further, cower behind your non-etymologist fears no 
						longer. I will explain the root to "Dressed to the Nines" in this post.

						Is ice frozen water, or is water melted ice? These are the questions I cannot answer,
						but I can answer where does the phrase "Breaking the Ice" come from? In this blog post, I 
						seek to answer one of the coldest linguistic mysteries in our language.
