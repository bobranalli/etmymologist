			If you're reading this blog you of course had the same question as myself, where does the phrase "Boxing Day" come
			from? Luckily for you, I've decided to put my journalist skills to test, and get to the bottom of this mystery.
			Finding the answer to this rather unassuming question proved harder than I originally thought. It took hours
			of research and diligent detective work to surf through the heaps and piles of false information and inaccuracies
			contributed by my peers and fellow journalists. So, enough fluff, where does "Boxing Day" come from...
			<br><br>
			If you were to ask a fool (or any of the so-called etymologists who all went to their preppy schools of which I 
			got rejected to due my "utter lack of both ability and understanding of the linguistic science"), they would most
			likely tell you that Boxing Day originated in the 1830s when boxes filled with small gifts and money would be given
			to household servants and employees on the 26th who had to work on December 25. Another similarly inept etymologist
			might tell you that the phrase Boxing Day has its roots in the Middle Ages, where giving gifts to the poor, more 
			specifically (and more incorrectly) it may reference the alms box placed in the narthex of Christian churches to 
			collect donations for the poor. As you might realize at this point, we're dealing with many low-level etymologists 
			who don't respect simple facts. How am I so sure that these leading theories are wrong? 
			<br><br>
			Let's start with the first one - they say that gifts were given in small boxes to the poor starting in the 1830s, 
			well cardboard wasn't even invented until the 1870s so how could they possibly have formed those small boxes? And 
			to those of you who are at this moment asking, couldn't they have made the boxes out of wood? No. Think about the 
			amount of wooden boxes that would need to be made. How many woodworkers do you think their were in the 1830s? It's 
			not like they grow on trees as their material companions due. And for the second theory - supposedly Boxing Day 
			can be traced back to the middle ages where people would donate gifts the poor. It was the Middle Ages, also known 
			as the Dark Ages. Everyone was poor, everything sucked back then. If people were giving gifts to the poor, they'd 
			be giving gifts to themselves, and there's no chance that would be established as the origin of a holiday. 
			Furthermore, if that is in fact the origin (kudos to the etymologist who got lucky on this one) then I refuse to 
			accept a self-serving holiday of indulgence and closehandedness. Now that we've debunked many of the leading 
			theories, I will present my case (also known as the definitely heavily researched truth).
			<br><br>
			Many of the scholars (if you can call them that) before me have overlooked the simplest answer to the question
			"where did Boxing Day originate?" It's called <i>Boxing</i> Day not "Box" Day, nor is it called "Middle and Dark 
			Ages People Find a Small Religious Box and Put Things Inside Said Box Day." Boxing has been around since the 
			earliest civilizations. Sumerians and Akkadians were boxing one another between the Tigris and Euphrates - they
			probably did at least, I didn't want to step on any historians' toes and conduct historical research, but take 
			my word for it, those Sumerians could pack a decent punch. So, how does the origin of boxing relate to the 26th of 
			December? Astute question. It is well known that Jesus was born on December 25th, but it is probably lesser known 
			that Jesus had a stellar left hand. Turn water into wine? How about turning rocks into gravel with a single jab. 
			While digging for the origin of Boxing Day I found that the very first Catholic Church, the first church to 
			worship Jesus, was constructed on December 26th using the gravel that was shaped by Jesus's <i>Fists of Glory.</i>
			So, there is it - after hours and hours of etymological research, the true origin of Boxing Day uncovered.
			<br><br>
			I hope you all have enjoyed reading, and I hope I have shed light on the lesser-understood Holiday that is Boxing 
			Day. If you have any comments, please leave them in the suggestion box in the "Suggestions" tab. If you choose to 
			disagree with me in any way, please be prepared to be proved wrong (or banned if the former option is not 
			possible). In addition, please leave a suggestion for any other phrases or words whose etymology you are curious 
			about.
