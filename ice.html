			I am back, yet again. This time we will be looking into "Breaking the Ice." This phrase is brought to us today by a 
			commenter named Reticent Reginald. Our new friend Reticent Reginald provided a terrific theory as to where this phrase 
			comes from. But before I share Reticent's thoughts and my own, I will of course guide us through the pathetic heaps of 
			guesses and "historically accurate" theories. Think of me as the Figurehead (the fancy carving on the front of the ship for
			those of you who lack nautical knowledge) and think of the theories we're about to debunk as the ocean waters that we carve 
			through. As a sickle cuts through wheat, we will cut through the blasphemy just as easily. So, what are the leading (and 
			incorrect theories)?

			<strong>LEADING THEORIES</strong>
			<br><br>
			"Breaking the Ice" typically refers to when two people meet for the first time and they need to start off the conversation.
			You will hear a variation of the phrase as "an ice breaker" or someone using a one-liner or conversation starter to lead 
			off a new conversation (speaking of conversation starters, give this one a try sometime if you want some quick success: 
			if you ever see an attractive person locking their bike up outside your favorite local cafe, once they've left their 
			bike, slighly place <i>your bike lock</i> on their bike. When they come out, they have no option but to stop and talk 
			as you fuddle around with taking your lock off their bike. If you need any more convincing of this tactic, my 
			slap-to-conversation ratio on this is only 9-to-1).
			<br><br>
			One of our readers offered some terrific insight into the widely used but wildly incorrect explanations- "Cursory research 
			on the matter yielded explanations that I found deeply unsettling. Briefly, the phrase stems from ice-breaking ships which 
			established routes to previously inaccessible polar regions. A post-Classical Latin variation “scindere glaciem” means to 
			open the way and to be the first in beginning a task." Obviously this doesn't make any sense - latin died out in the 6th 
			century AD, while Europeans did not discover the arctic until the 10th century. Yet again, another pathetic explanation 
			debunked.			<br><br>
			<strong>MY (CORRECT) THEORY</strong>
			<br><br>
			Here is the correct theory. Eskimos needed to break the ice to fish. There is nothing more awkward than two eskimos sitting 
			around the ice pit without anything to say to each other (trust me I did an ethnography in the south pole). Have you ever 
			heard two eskimos that don't know each other try to make conversation? I mean Jesus Christ, how many different ways can you 
			talk about the snow? To give some context to picture this better, imagine the droning discourse between two old guys at the 
			bar that don't know each other (not a great start). Now imagine if those two old guys had been surrounded by nothing but 
			snow the last 60 years. That's what we're working with. Therefore, this lack of free-flowing conversation led to the need 
			for conversation starters which were heavily pioneered by the most adept ice-breakers on the planet - the Eskimos.
